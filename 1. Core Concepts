## Creating a Pod and Inspecting it

4. Change the image of the Pod to `nginx:1.15.12`.

7. Retrieve the IP address of the Pod `mypod`.
8. Run a temporary Pod using the image `busybox`, shell into it and run a `wget` command against the `nginx` Pod using port 80.
9. Render the logs of Pod `mypod`.
10. Delete the Pod and the namespace.
