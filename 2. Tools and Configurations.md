## Exam tips

## You edit specifications of an existing POD other than the below.

   ```spec.containers[*].image```
   ```spec.initContainers[*].image```
   ```spec.activeDeadlineSeconds```
   ```spec.tolerations```
	
For example you cannot edit the environment variables, service accounts, resource limits (all of which we will discuss later) of a running pod. But if you really want to, you have 2 options:

1. If you kubectl edit pod <pod name> command. This will open the pod specification in an editor (vi editor). Then edit the required properties. When you try to save it, you will be denied. This is because you are attempting to edit a field on the pod that is not editable.


A copy of the file with your changes is saved in a temporary location for example /tmp/kubectl-edit-ccvrq.yaml.

You can then delete the existing pod by running the command:

```kubectl delete pod redis```

Then create a new pod with your changes using the temporary file:

```kubectl create -f /tmp/kubectl-edit-ccvab.yaml```

2. The second option is to extract the pod definition in YAML format to a file using the command

```kubectl get pod redis -o yaml > my-new-pod.yaml```

Then make the changes to the exported file using an editor (vi editor). Save the changes

```vi my-new-pod.yaml```

Then delete the existing pod

```kubectl delete pod redis```

Then create a new pod with the edited file

```kubectl create -f my-new-pod.yaml```

## Edit Deployments
With Deployments you can easily edit any field/property of the POD template. Since the pod template is a child of the deployment specification, with every change the deployment will automatically delete and create a new pod with the new changes. So if you are asked to edit a property of a POD part of a deployment you may do that simply by running the command

```kubectl edit deployment my-deployment```

What is the environment variable name set on the container in the pod?

What is the value set on the environment variable APP_COLOR on the container in the pod?

Note: Delete and recreate the POD. Only make the necessary changes. Do not modify the name of the Pod.
