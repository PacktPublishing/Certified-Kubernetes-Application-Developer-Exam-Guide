## Exam tips

## You edit specifications of an existing POD other than the below.

   ```spec.containers[*].image```
   ```spec.initContainers[*].image```
   ```spec.activeDeadlineSeconds```
   ```spec.tolerations```
	
For example you cannot edit the environment variables, service accounts, resource limits (all of which we will discuss later) of a running pod. But if you really want to, you have 2 options:

##### 1. If you kubectl edit pod <pod name> command. This will open the pod specification in an editor (vi editor). Then edit the required properties. When you try to save it, you will be denied. This is because you are attempting to edit a field on the pod that is not editable.


A copy of the file with your changes is saved in a temporary location for example /tmp/kubectl-edit-ccvrq.yaml.

You can then delete the existing pod by running the command:

```kubectl delete pod redis```

Then create a new pod with your changes using the temporary file:

```kubectl create -f /tmp/kubectl-edit-ccvab.yaml```

##### 2. The second option is to extract the pod definition in YAML format to a file using the command

```kubectl get pod redis -o yaml > my-new-pod.yaml```

Then make the changes to the exported file using an editor (vi editor). Save the changes

```vi my-new-pod.yaml```

Then delete the existing pod

```kubectl delete pod redis```

Then create a new pod with the edited file

```kubectl create -f my-new-pod.yaml```

## Edit Deployments
With Deployments you can easily edit any field/property of the POD template. Since the pod template is a child of the deployment specification, with every change the deployment will automatically delete and create a new pod with the new changes. So if you are asked to edit a property of a POD part of a deployment you may do that simply by running the command

```kubectl edit deployment my-deployment```

##### What is the environment variable name set on the container in the pod?

##### What is the value set on the environment variable APP_COLOR on the container in the pod?


##### Update the environment variable on the POD to display a green background

	Note: Delete and recreate the POD. Only make the necessary changes. Do not modify the name of the Pod.
	
	View the changes to the web application UI by clicking on the Webapp Color Tab above your terminal.


	If you already have it open, simply refresh the browser.
	
##### How many ConfigMaps exists in the default namespace?


##### Identify the database host from the config map db-config

##### Create a new ConfigMap for the webapp-color POD. Use the spec given below.

##### Update the environment variable on the POD to use the newly created ConfigMap

	Note: Delete and recreate the POD. Only make the necessary changes. Do not modify the name of the Pod.

	CheckCompleteIncomplete
	Pod Name: webapp-color

	EnvFrom: webapp-config-map
	
	View the changes to the web application UI by clicking on the Webapp Color Tab above your terminal.


	If you already have it open, simply refresh the browser.

##### What is the user used to execute the sleep process within the ubuntu-sleeper pod?

##### Edit the pod ubuntu-sleeper to run the sleep process with user ID 1010.

	Note: Only make the necessary changes. Do not modify the name or image of the pod.

	CheckCompleteIncomplete
	Pod Name: ubuntu-sleeper

	Image Name: ubuntu

	SecurityContext: User 1010	

##### A Pod definition file named multi-pod.yaml is given. With what user are the processes in the web container started? The pod is created with multiple containers and security contexts defined at the Pod and Container level.


	1000
	1001
	1002
	root
	
##### With what user are the processes in the sidecar container started? The pod is created with multiple containers and security contexts defined at the Pod and Container level.

	1000
	1001
	1002
	root

##### Update pod ubuntu-sleeper to run as Root user and with the SYS_TIME capability.

	Note: Only make the necessary changes. Do not modify the name of the pod.

	CheckCompleteIncomplete
	Pod Name: ubuntu-sleeper

	Image Name: ubuntu

	SecurityContext: Capability SYS_TIME
	
##### Now update the pod to also make use of the NET_ADMIN capability.

	Note: Only make the necessary changes. Do not modify the name of the pod.

	CheckCompleteIncomplete
	Pod Name: ubuntu-sleeper

	Image Name: ubuntu

	SecurityContext: Capability SYS_TIME

	SecurityContext: Capability NET_ADMIN	
	
 	
##### A pod called rabbit is deployed. Identify the CPU requirements set on the Pod, in the current(default) namespace

	1
	4
	3
	2	
	0
	
##### Delete the rabbit Pod.

	Once deleted, wait for the pod to fully terminate.

	CheckCompleteIncomplete
	Delete Pod rabbit	
	
##### Another pod called elephant has been deployed in the default namespace. It fails to get to a running state. Inspect this pod and identify the Reason why it is not running.

	OOMKilled
	CrashLoopBackOff
	Running
	Ready	
	
##### The status OOMKilled indicates that it is failing because the pod ran out of memory. Identify the memory limit set on the POD.
	
##### The elephant pod runs a process that consumes 15Mi of memory. Increase the limit of the elephant pod to 20Mi. Delete and recreate the pod if required. Do not modify anything other than the required fields. CheckCompleteIncomplete

	Pod Name: elephant
	Image Name: polinux/stress
	Memory Limit: 20Mi	

#####Inspect the status of POD. Make sure it's running

##### Delete the elephant Pod. Once deleted, wait for the pod to fully terminate.	
	
##### How many Service Accounts exist in the default namespace?
	
##### What is the secret token used by the default service account?

##### We just deployed the Dashboard application. Inspect the deployment. What is the image used by the deployment?

##### Wait for the deployment to be ready. Access the custom-dashboard by clicking on the link to dashboard portal.

##### What is the state of the dashboard? Have the pod details loaded successfully?

##### What type of account does the Dashboard application use to query the Kubernetes API?

	LDAP Account
	OAuth Account
	Service Account
	User Account	
	
##### Which account does the Dashboard application use to query the Kubernetes API?

	Administrator
	Kube-admin
	Admin
	Default	
	
##### Inspect the Dashboard Application POD and identify the Service Account mounted on it.

	service-account
	dashboard-sa
	default
	
##### At what location is the ServiceAccount credentials available within the pod?

	/etc/run/secrets
	/opt/run/secrets
	/var/run/secrets
	/var/run/token	
	
##### The application needs a ServiceAccount with the Right permissions to be created to authenticate to Kubernetes. The default ServiceAccount has limited access. Create a new ServiceAccount named dashboard-sa.

	Service Account Name: dashboard-sa	
	
##### We just added additional permissions for the newly created dashboard-sa account using RBAC.


	If you are interested checkout the files used to configure RBAC at /var/rbac. We will discuss RBAC in a separate section.

##### Enter the access token in the UI of the dashboard application. Click Load Dashboard button to load Dashboard

	Create an authorization token for the newly created service account, copy the generated token and paste it into the token field of the UI.

	To do this, run kubectl create token dashboard-sa for the dashboard-sa service account, copy the token and paste it in the UI.
	
	
##### You shouldn't have to copy and paste the token each time. The Dashboard application is programmed to read token from the secret mount location. However currently, the default service account is mounted. Update the deployment to use the newly created ServiceAccount

###### Edit the deployment to change ServiceAccount from default to dashboard-sa.

	Deployment name: web-dashboard
	Service Account: dashboard-sa
	Deployment Ready
